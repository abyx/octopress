<div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="/2010/11/06/refactoring-youre-doing-it-wrong/">last blog</a> was about how many people refer to refactoring as the wrong thing. For completeness of discussion I&#8217;d like to talk about what a lot of people seemed to not get in my previous post. I said that the &#8216;Big Refactoring&#8217; is the new &#8216;Big Redesign in the Sky&#8217;, and got a bunch of questions along the linse of &#8220;so we&#8217;re never supposed to redesign?&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, of course that&#8217;s not the case. Even the best programmers occasionally dig themselves into a hole that will require some effort to get out of. The point is that the best thing to do is never to take those 2 days to 2 weeks period just for doing that refactoring. That is never the right approach to solve such a problem.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts_images/stairway_to_heaven.jpg" width="300" height="225"></p>

<p>First of all, I&#8217;ve seen many times that it was intended to spend &#8220;only&#8221; 2 days (which is already a huge amount of time) to do some refactoring, but 2 days in, the dev team found it they actually need 2 more days because of extra complications they&#8217;ve got, and the team&#8217;s lucky if after a week of hard work they still have a working system, not to mention better.</p>

<p>Another problem with that is, once the devs think they have a picture in mind of this perfect redesign that management won&#8217;t let them take a week to get to (with good reason!), a lot developers stop thinking about how to make the current code better. It&#8217;s just let&#8217;s add this hack here, because management won&#8217;t let us do this the right way. That&#8217;s BS. Will you come to your dentist 3 days in a row for &#8216;general groundwork&#8217; before have a 2 hour filling? I thought so.</p>

<p>Programming is about adding value. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like writing elegant and clean code as much as the next guy (actually, probably a bit more given I walk around with one of <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.GreenWristBand">these</a>). But, what we&#8217;re hired to do is solve problems and help someone&#8217;s life by doing it. If all we do is bitch about how the design could be better, we&#8217;re only benefiting ourselves, and not doing a good job at it.</p>

<p>So what is the right way? Well, the right way is to pull things off towards the right direction, in steady and controlled baby steps. I&#8217;ve seen this work, and I&#8217;ve heard from much better programmers than myself that they&#8217;ve got it working multiple times. After spending a day in an awesome <a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/blog/?page_id=379">Responsive Design</a> workshop by Kent Beck, I was a bit amazed to hear there are so many ways of pushing design towards a better place in baby steps. Up until that point I would have done it anyway, but Kent taught me there&#8217;s actually an art to it.</p>

<p>Do you think it&#8217;s impossible in your case because &#8220;X is too big&#8221;? Well, say you&#8217;ve got N steps in your redesign, all are safe atomic changes. Many of the times you might think the order of steps you&#8217;ve came up with simply won&#8217;t do and it will be too hard to do it without the big blunder. But, think about it this way: Those N steps have N! (N-factorial) different ways to be ordered. What are the odds that none of those ways will solve your problem? I&#8217;ve yet to see when this is not the case (and this, among others, is why you should spend the time with better and more experienced coders, such as Kent).</p>

<p>Yes, it means that &#8220;2 day refactoring&#8221; of yours will probably be spread over 2 weeks (which is just might have done anyway). But it also means that no matter what happens during those 2 weeks, you&#8217;re always on the safe side. Find out after 2 days that your idea simply won&#8217;t cut it? Well, no biggie. The code still works, and you added features those 2 days. Find out it&#8217;ll take longer? Yeah, so what. We&#8217;re doing a few small steps a day anyway. The awesome thing is that you&#8217;ve got time to learn during the work what you may have thought up wrong and use that as input for the next parts of the refactoring. No rush here. And I think the most important point is that if you simply spend 30 minutes a day to refactor things at the right direction, weaved into your daily work and refactorings, you&#8217;ll get it done without have to pitch your Big Redesign to management.</p>

<p>This allows you to simply do what you&#8217;re supposed to do: add value to customers daily, while making sure the system stays responsive to future changes. And that, my friends, is how the big refactoring should be done.</p>
