Just a quick let-you-know: I found out that the gists I use to embed code in my posts don't show up on RSS readers (e.g. Google Reader).

I know how annoying it is not to be able to read a blog fully from my reader for me, and so found a nice Wordpress plugin called [Embed GitHub Gist](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/embed-github-gist/) that handling embedding gists elegantly and also automatically makes sure the code will be displayed even on readers.

I've even updated my latest post (about Chef and EC2) to work with it, and new posts from now on will look good too :)
