You sit down and start your next frontend task.
Likely, that task will require you to get input from the user.
Maybe you‚Äôre adding a comments section, maybe it‚Äôs a little survey, or some simple form.

Handling inputs and forms with AngularJS can be a breeze, especially since AngularJS provides a lot of tools for efficiently doing just that.
You need to add validations, like making sure the user filled all the fields, and it‚Äôs just a matter of adding a `required` attribute to all controls and checking the form‚Äôs `$valid` property.

I love it when instead of writing lots of code I simply do something along the lines of:

```html
<button ng-disabled="!$ctrl.form.$valid" type="submit">Save</button>
```

(I‚Äôm not missing an `ng-click` there BTW, for submitting a form you should usually have `ng-submit` on the `<form>` element.)

But, what happens when you have use some custom control, instead of the browser‚Äôs builtins (e.g. `input`s, `textarea`s, `select`s)?

It usually looks ends up looking like this:

```html
<my-custom-control value="$ctrl.someValue"></my-custom-control>
```

And suddenly, you can‚Äôt just use `required`, and the form‚Äôs `$valid` doesn‚Äôt work, and instead of using `$ctrl.form.$valid` to check everything is filled you have to write code along the lines of:

```javascript
function isValid() {
  return self.form.$valid && self.someValue !== '';
}
```

## Custom Controls Don‚Äôt Have to Suck

You don‚Äôt have to leave the comforts of Angular‚Äôs forms just because you have a custom control.
You just need to make sure to wire things up properly.

It‚Äôs as easy as using `ng-model` to pass the value to the control, instead of some binding of yours.
Here‚Äôs an example of refactoring a component to use ngModel:

```javascript
angular.module('app').component('myCustomControl', {
  template: '...',
  bindings: {
    value: '=ngModel'
  }
});
```

You can still use the same name the component used before, such as `value` above, but make sure that the external name is `ngModel`.
Using that component looks like so:

```javascript
<my-custom-control ng-model="$ctrl.someValue" required>
```

Just by using the `ng-model` attribute, Angular‚Äôs `ngModel` directive will be used, and sprinkle its own magic.
That means that it‚Äôll register with the parent form, and add the needed validations.

For example, the `required` above will simply work now, and so will our original button, no need for custom code.

So _please_ don‚Äôt write custom controls like an animal.
Use Angular properly.
