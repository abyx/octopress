WatchKit is finally out, and of course I started playing with it right away.

I find it a bit awkward to get my first glance running, since I had to create a custom scheme, understand the watch is an "external display" and restart the app a couple of times. I whipped up a short (and crude) 2.5 minutes video showing just that, in case you wanna get started on the hacking as well!

Happy (WatchKit) coding!
