We knew this was a long time coming, and it’s finally here.
The Angular Team has [announced](https://blog.angular.io/stable-angularjs-and-long-term-support-7e077635ee9c) that they will soon release *AngularJS 1.7.0*, which will be the *last minor release*.

# What will happen now?

Regular development of 1.7 will continue, meaning we can expect 1.7.1, 1.7.2, etc. until *June 30, 2018*.
All these releases will contain bug fixes and features that are *not breaking changes*.

# What will happen next?

After June 30, AngularJS 1.7 will go into *Long Term Support*.
This means that for 3 years the Angular team will support AngularJS and make changes to make sure it continues functioning.
There will be no new features.
Bug fixes will only be released in case a security flaw is found, or if a change to jQuery or a major browser breaks 1.7.

# Why now?

Google say that in October 2017 the number of active Angular (that is, 2+) developers has surpassed that of AngularJS developers, which was their cue all along to when they can start wrapping up 1.x.

# What should you do now?

If you’re still running 1.x, I highly recommend taking the time and moving to 1.6 (see my [Modern AngularJS Migration Guide](http://www.codelord.net/modern-angularjs-migration-guide/)).

1.7 will be released soon, but it will also remove lots of deprecated APIs, meaning you can expect to need to change older code and update older dependencies.

# And then what?

Hmm.
That’s a tough one.
I’ll be talking about it some more in the upcoming future, so make sure the sign up below!
