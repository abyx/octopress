Last week I taught a "From Objective-C to Swift" introductory workshop. As part of it I create 3 playgrounds with basic exercises (along with matching playgrounds with solutions). In case you're reading the Swift iBooks from Apple and want to get your fingers a little dirty, these shouldn't take more than an hour to complete.

Please leave a comment if you found it helpful, have a better solution to an exercise, or whatever!
