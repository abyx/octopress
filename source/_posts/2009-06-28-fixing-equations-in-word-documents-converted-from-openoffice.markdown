This is a short tip post. If you were ever frustrated with the fact that OpenOffice documents with equations don't show up properly when converted to MS-Word documents you're gonna love this!

It's a known problem that converted equations need to be "double clicked" in Word for it to re-render them and show up properly. Turns out someone has posted a great macro [here](http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=66787) that simply does that automatically for you and saves the need to go through the whole document manually (if you don't remember how to set up a macro, like me, there are nice instructions [here](http://www.officeletter.com/favtips/wordmacros.html)).
