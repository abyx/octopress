Earlier today I gave a talk at the [Israeli Ruby Underground meetup](http://www.meetup.com/IsraelRubyUnderground/events/46244082/) about Rubinius, including a **quick hacking session** showing how one can remove `else` from `unless`. Below you can find the slides.

As every hacker I strive to become better, so if you attended the talk I'd **greatly appreciate** it if you would spare a minute and [rate it here](http://speakerrate.com/talks/9811-introduction-to-rubinius).
