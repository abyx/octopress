It's been almost a year now since the founding of our local [Software Craftsmanship](http://scil.eventbrite.com/) group. This, for me, is a huge dream-come-true.

For years I've been looking for a good community around here to join, went to several meetups and looked around to no avail. My frustration grew about a year ago when I noticed the Chicago community is so buzzing with activity, people there have a meetup every day almost. That's why when [Uri](http://twitter.com/urilavi) started organizing the first meeting I jumped in whole-heartedly.

In just a few months the meeting has influenced me quite a lot. First of all I got to meet a lot of new, smart and interestingÂ people I never would have otherwise. It's not easy to find people that are as passionate about our profession as I am, yet our group didn't disappoint me.

The meetings also supply my need to pair with new people. Pair programming is a magical way of working and sharing knowledge, and I've yet to have a session with a new pair without picking up something new. I love the first minutes where we have to find a common language to get things started, and even more the high fives of getting a green bar.

Also, a good community is the best way to get feedback. I can say I'm trying to leech this to the max. I've already gave talks/sessions at 2 meetings, bugging people frequently on twitter and the mailing list. A varied community of like minded people allows you to get different outlooks and insights to things you've been neck-deep in for a while.

And last but not least, a good community might make magic stuff happen. I don't know how, but I'm sure our group had something to do with the fact some of us got to have dinner with [Uncle Bob](http://twitter.com/unclebobmartin) and [Brett Schuchert](http://twitter.com/schuchert), two awesome coders and [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thcodu02-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0132350882)<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thcodu02-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0132350882" style="width: 0; height: 0; display: none; border: none !important;"> authors, on their last visit here.

Bottom line, be part of a community, and if there isn't one around you help start it! It's a great source of [kindred spirits](http://apprenticeship-patterns.labs.oreilly.com/ch04.html#kindred_spirits), an invaluable and rare resource!
