About 7 years ago I posted my first post on this blog - [One Book A Month](/2008/04/25/one-book-a-month/). In it I make the point of the importance of reading and constantly learning: the person that stops learning that stops living. I attribute a lot of my success to the fact that I constantly try to learn new things.

But, as with everything, it's possible to push this too far. I've [read around 20 books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3879094-aviv-ben-yosef?read_at=2014&view=covers) in 2014, listened to *hundreds* of podcasts and read countless blog posts. I never liked "wasting time" - not a lot of TV watching, not playing games, etc. Instead I had this urge to keep learning. 

I recently realized that this habit has become busywork. I kept filling my time. Learning helps, but sometimes enough is enough.

## What was I getting out of all of this learning?

After all, does it matter that I've read every book on technology X if I never use it? I can keep reading every post [Amy Hoy](http://unicornfree.com) wrote and swallow [*Just Fucking Ship*](https://unicornfree.com/just-fucking-ship) in a day, but if I never *ship* what good is it? If I read 10,000 pages, but didn't act - *did I really read anything?*

## If you have to ship - ship, don't read

I decided to actively spend less of my time consuming. Even though it is intellectual consuming and not time wasting per se, it sums up to the same result. I will focus more of my time to writing blog posts, side projects, etc. With this, I hope, I will build up once more a habit of shipping fast and often. 

Will it make a big difference? Only time will tell, but I believe it will. And don't get me wrong, I'll probably still read a handful of books, since that really is my hobby, but I'll treat it as a hobby and so will make sure it doesn't eat up too many hours that could have been invested in laying out the bricks to getting myself someplace better.
