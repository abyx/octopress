Continuing from my [previous post](http://www.codelord.net/2016/11/30/advanced-angular-1-dot-x-component-communication-with-require/) about advanced component communication with Angular's `require` mechanism, I decided to try and walkthrough such an example refactoring, based on real code I've seen multiple times.

This shows the actual steps you need to take to change existing code to use `require` and also shares some of my philosophy on when it should be used.

This is my first video ever, and I'd love to hear your feedback!

The source code for the before and after states is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/abyx/angular-require-video).
