You want to do Angular *the right way*.  
You hate spending time working on a project, only to find it's completely wrong a month later.  
But, as you try to get things right, you end up staring at the blinking cursor in your IDE, not sure what to type.  
Every line of code you write means making decisions, and it's paralyzing.  

You look at blog posts, tutorials, videos, but each is a bit different.  
Now you need to *reverse engineer every advice* to see what version of Angular it was written for, how updated it is, and whether it fits the current way of doing things.

What if you knew the *Angular Way* of doing things?  
Imagine knocking down your tasks and spending your brain cycles on your product's core.  
Wouldn't it be nice to know Angular like a second language?
