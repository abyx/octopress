# The What-Do-I-Do-With-My-Angular-Project Package

You've already invested in learning and developing a working Angular 1 app.  
And now you're unsure about the future of it.  
Maybe continue with 1.x but use components and one-way bindings?  
Or should you upgrade to Angular 2? When? How? How long will it take?  
Should you use ES5, ES6, TypeScript?

I can help you pick a *tailor-made path* that's appropriate for you, your team and your business's goals.  

The package includes:

- High level code review of your existing app (deep code review upgrade available)
- An interview and roadmapping session (remotely, about 2 hours)
- Availability for emailing questions for 2 months (can be extended)

The package costs only *$799*.
