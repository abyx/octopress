My name's Aviv Ben-Yosef.

You can contact me by [e-mail](mailto:aviv.by+blog@gmail.com), or [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/avivby).

I'm a software developer from Israel and have been programming and fascinated by programming for the past 10 years.

I love reading about code, writing about code and, of course, writing code !

Among other things, I work at [BillGuard](http://www.billguard.com) and am a panelist on the [TRuby Podcast](http://rauchy.net/truby) (Hebrew podcast about Ruby).
