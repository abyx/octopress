My name's Aviv Ben-Yosef.

You can contact me by [e-mail](mailto:aviv.by+blog@gmail.com), or [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/avivby).

For the past few years I've focused on solving the right problems and in a high quality fashion. Life's too short to ship shit.

I am currently consulting, mainly full-stack and mobile. [Hire me](mailto:aviv.by+blog@gmail.com?subject=Hiring%20You).

Among other things, I worked at [BillGuard](http://www.billguard.com) and am a panelist on the [Mobile and Beer Podcast](http://www.mobileandbeer.com) (Hebrew).
