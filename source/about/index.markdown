My name's Aviv Ben-Yosef.

You can contact me by [e-mail](mailto:aviv.by+blog@gmail.com), or [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/avivby).

I'm a software engineer from Israel and have been programming and fascinated by programming since I was 9.

I love reading about code, writing about code and, of course, writing code !

I am currently consulting, mainly full-stack and mobile. [Hire me](mailto:aviv.by+blog@gmail.com?subject=Hiring%20You).

Among other things, I worked at [BillGuard](http://www.billguard.com) and am a panelist on the [Mobile and Beer Podcast](http://www.mobileandbeer.com) (Hebrew).
