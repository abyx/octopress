Want an RSS feed for your twitter account? Miss all the magic you could do with Twitter triggers on [IFTTT](http://www.ifttt.com)?  

I've released open source code to set up a server that would allow you to do this [here](/2013/06/21/do-it-yourself-twitter-triggers-for-ifttt/).

In case setting up servers is not your cup of tea, I can do the one time installation for you for $50 - just [*Contact Me*](mailto:aviv.by+fweets@gmail.com).
